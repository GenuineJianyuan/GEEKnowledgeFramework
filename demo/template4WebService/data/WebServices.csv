Fill,Fills sinks in a surface raster to remove small imperfections in the data.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/fill.htm
Flow Direction,"Creates a raster of flow direction from each cell to its downslope neighbor, or neighbors, using D8, Multiple Flow Direction (MFD) or D-Infinity (DINF) methods",https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/flow-direction.htm
Interpolate Shape,Creates 3D features by interpolating z-values from a surface.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/3d-analyst-toolbox/interpolate-shape.htm
Kriging,Interpolates a raster surface from points using kriging.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/kriging.htm
Reclassify,Reclassifies (or changes) the values in a raster.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/reclassify.htm
Slope,Identifies the slope (gradient or steepness) from each cell of a raster.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/slope.htm
Zonal Statistics,Calculates statistics on values of a raster within the zones of another dataset.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/zonal-statistics.htm
Slice,Divides the range of raster values into classes using various methods such as equal interval or natural breaks.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/slice.htm
Kernel Density,Calculates a magnitude-per-unit area from point or polyline features using a kernel function to fit a smoothly tapered surface to each point or polyline.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/kernel-density.htm
Intersect,Computes a geometric intersection of the input features. Features or portions of features which overlap in all layers and/or feature classes will be written to the output feature class.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/analysis-toolbox/intersect.htm
Plus,Adds (sums) the values of two rasters on a cell-by-cell basis.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/plus.htm
Times,Multiplies the values of two rasters on a cell-by-cell basis.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/times.htm
Con,Performs a conditional if/else evaluation on each of the input cells of an input raster.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/con-.htm
Buffer,Creates buffer polygons around input features to a specified distance.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/analysis-toolbox/buffer.htm
Dissolve,Aggregates features based on specified attributes.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/data-management-toolbox/dissolve.htm
Spatial Join,Joins attributes from one feature to another based on the spatial relationship. The target features and the joined attributes from the join features are written to the output feature class.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/analysis-toolbox/spatial-join.htm
IDW,Interpolates a raster surface from points using an inverse distance weighted (IDW) technique.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/idw.htm
Extract by Mask,Extracts the cells of a raster that correspond to the areas defined by a mask.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/extract-by-mask.htm
Divide,Divides the values of two rasters on a cell-by-cell basis.,https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/divide.htm
NDVI,"The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a standardized index allowing you to generate an image displaying greenness, also known as relative biomass. This index takes advantage of the contrast of characteristics between two bands from a multispectral raster dataset¡ªthe chlorophyll pigment absorption in the red band and the high reflectivity of plant material in the near-infrared (NIR) band.",https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/ndvi-function.htm
