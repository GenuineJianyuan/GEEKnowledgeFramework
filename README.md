# This is the repository for the paper:

**A knowledge extraction and encapsulation framework for reusing geo-analysis models in Google Earth Engine**

## Projects

1. **eePromptEngineering** - The Project with Prompts and ChatGPT for Descriptive Modeling Knowledge Extraction:
   This project serves as a simple demonstration to convey the concept. More complex rules or frameworks, such as CoT (Chain of Thought), can be constructed for optimization purposes.

2. **eeFlowExtractor** - The Project with an AST-based algorithm for Procedural Modeling Knowledge Extraction (Under Testing).

3. **eeKnowledgeTemplate** - A complete instance of the encapsulation template for the GEE geo-analysis model.
