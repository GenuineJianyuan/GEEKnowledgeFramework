The evaluation dictionary contains all ground truth data, prediction, statistics and analysis code of the quantitative evaluation for 
the proposed method in the manuscript. 

The api_ground_truth records all API relations of sample codes, while true_value.csv stores the true value of descriptive knowledge 
for each sample.

Three evaluations are performed - stability analysis,  descriptive knowledge extraction accuracy, and procedural knowledge extraction 
reliability based on accuracy, recall and F1 score.
