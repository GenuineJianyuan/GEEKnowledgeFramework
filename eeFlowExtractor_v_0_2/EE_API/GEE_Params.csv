(optional parameters apply only when filePerBand is true):

¬†¬†¬†¬†+ id: the name of the band, a string, required.

Each rule should be defined by a rule type and a direction (ASC or DESC), separated by a space. Valid rule types are: "".geometryType"", "".minZoomLevel"", or a feature property name. The value "".geometryType"" refers to points, lines, and polygons. The value "".minZoomLevel"" refers to the minimum zoom level that a feature is visible. Points are visible at all zoom levels, so they have the smallest minZoomLevel. For example, a valid set of ranking rules could be: 'my-property DESC,

.geometryType ASC, .minZoomLevel ASC'. The same set of rules expressed as a list of strings would be: ['my-property DESC', '.geometryType ASC',

'.minZoomLevel ASC']. This means when thinning at a particular level of detail on the map, prioritize features with a larger ""my-property"" value first (thin features with a smaller value of ""my-property""), prioritize features with a smaller geometry type (e.g. thin out polygons before lines and thinning out lines before points), and prioritize features with a smaller minimum zoom level (points over large polygons over smaller polygons).",473,Export.table.toFeatureView,List,,0
